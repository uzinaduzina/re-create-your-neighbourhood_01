# The Project


---


The launching idea came from Praga Culture Centre from Warsaw in Poland, in an old neighborhood waiting to be renovated. The Cultural center proposed to the inhabitants workshops about decorative crafts such as batik, ceramic, soil painting. Since, they decided to bring this project to European level in a Grundtvig educative partnership. Each partner organize local workshops and a transnational meeting. It widen the project to all that could enhanced urban spaces and quality of life for its inhabitants. A blog, a photo exhibition, a photo guide, a photo edition, an e-book ”users manual” will be realized by the partners.

Objectives and activities :

* To establish an international network of organizations and institutions working with local communities for social and cultural benefits of the local neighborhoods.
* To support participants of the project to develop their skills and enrich their knowledge related to arts and crafts in urban spaces.
* To integrate local communities whose members are involved in transforming and re-creating their neighborhoods.
* To engage in the project participants from socialy disadvantaged communities and enable adults with fewer opportunities to travel abroad and acquire new skills and knowledge.
* To transform local neighborhoods (backyards, squares, balconies, staircases) into enjoyable meeting places which create a sense of belonging for the members of local communities.

We’ll organize open meetings related to the main activities of the project (open for participants of international exchanges but also for other members of local communities) :


* How to organize urban gardening ? How to grow and take care of flowers, plants?
